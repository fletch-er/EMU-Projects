Introduction to Grammars

Grammar = 
({S, A, B}, {a, b, c}, S, P)
Our variable set has three variables, S A B. S is our start variable. P is the production/grammar rules.
In this grammar, we have 5 rules. 
What are these rules?
On the left is one of our variables
On the right is any combination of any variables and terminals in any order or any form
To read these rules, is "S goes to AB", "S goes to aA", etc
We use these rules to create strings (sequences of characters)

	P: S -> AB (rule 1)
		A -> aA (rule 2)
		A -> a (rule 3)
		B -> bBc (rule 4)
		B -> Lambda (rule 5)
		
Deriving a string:

S -> AB (using rule 1)
	-> AbBc (using rule 4)
	-> aABbC (using rule 2)
	-> aabBc (using rule 3)
	-> aabbBcc (using rule 4)
	-> aabbcc (using rule 5)
	
	Think of these as a series of translations from one set of variables to another synonymous set 
	Rule number 5 (lambda) means empty string. We can make it disappear.
